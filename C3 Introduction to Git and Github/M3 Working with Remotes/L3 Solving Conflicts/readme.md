# Conflict Resolution Cheat Sheet

Merge conflicts are not uncommon when working in a team of developers, or on Open Source Software. Fortunately, GitHub has some good documentation on how to handle them when they happen:

You can also use [git rebase branchname](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing) to change the base of the current branch to be branchname

The git rebase command is a lot more powerful.  Check out [this link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History) for more information.
