## Setting up Your Environment

<hr>

After you’ve installed Python and checked that it works, the next step to set up your developer environment is to choose your main code editor.

These are some of the common editors for Python, available for all platforms:

* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/)
* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

You can read more about these editors, and others, in these overview comparatives:
