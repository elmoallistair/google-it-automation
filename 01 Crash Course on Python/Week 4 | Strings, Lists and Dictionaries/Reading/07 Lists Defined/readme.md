# Lists Defined

Lists in Python are defined using square brackets, with the elements stored in the list separated by commas: **list = ["This", "is", "a", "list"]**. You can use the **len()** function to return the number of elements in a list: **len(list)** would return **4**. You can also use the **in** keyword to check if a list contains a certain element. If the element is present, it will return a True boolean. If the element is not found in the list, it will return False. For example, **"This" in list** would return True in our example. Similar to strings, lists can also use indexing to access specific elements in a list based on their position. You can access the first element in a list by doing **list[0]**, which would allow you to access the string **"This"**.

In Python, lists and strings are quite similar. They’re both examples of sequences of data. Sequences have similar properties, like:
(1) being able to iterate over them using **for loops**; 
(2) support indexing; 
(3) using the **len** function to find the length of the sequence; 
(4) using the plus operator +** **in order to concatenate; and 
(5) using the **in** keyword to check if the sequence contains a value. Understanding these concepts allows you to apply them to other sequence types as well.
