## *if* Statements Recap

<hr>

We can use the concept of **branching** to have our code alter its execution sequence depending on the values of variables. We can use an **if** statement to evaluate a comparison. We start with the **if** keyword, followed by our comparison. We end the line with a colon. The body of the **if** statement is then indented to the right. If the comparison is ***True***, the code inside the **if** body is executed. If the comparison evaluates to ***False***, then the code block is skipped and will not be run.
