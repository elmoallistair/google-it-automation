## More Complex Branching with elif Statements

<hr>

Building off of the *if* and *else* blocks, which allow us to branch our code depending on the evaluation of one statement, the *elif* statement allows us even more comparisons to perform more complex branching. Very similar to the *if* statements, an *elif* statement starts with the *elif* keyword, followed by a comparison to be evaluated. This is followed by a colon, and then the code block on the next line, indented to the right. An *elif* statement must follow an *if* statement, and will only be evaluated if the *if* statement was evaluated as false. You can include multiple *elif* statements to build complex branching in your code to do all kinds of powerful things!
