# What Is a Method?

Calling methods on objects executes functions that operate on attributes of a specific instance of the class. This means that calling a method on a list, for example, only modifies that instance of a list, and not all lists globally. We can define methods within a class by creating functions inside the class definition. These instance methods can take a parameter called **self** which represents the instance the method is being executed on. This will allow you to access attributes of the instance using dot notation, like **`self.name`**, which will access the name attribute of that specific instance of the class object. When you have variables that contain different values for different instances, these are called instance variables.
