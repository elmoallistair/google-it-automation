# Data Types Recap

In Python, text in between quotes -- either single or double quotes -- is a string data type. An integer is a whole number, without a fraction, while a float is a real number that can contain a fractional part. For example, 1, 7, 342 are all integers, while 5.3, 3.14159 and 6.0 are all floats. When attempting to mix incompatible data types, you may encounter a **TypeError**. You can always check the data type of something using the *type()* function.
